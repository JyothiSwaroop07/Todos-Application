# Todos-Application

This is a persistent todo application with CRUD operations to track list of tasks

    ● This application displays list of todos with HTML list elements, styled todo list using CSS, Bootstrap

    ● I had implemented todo crud operations by using JavaScript event listeners and updated UI dynamically by
      using JavaScript DOM operations.

    ● I had used Arrays, Objects and their methods during todolist CRUD Operations, Persisted todo list state on
      page reloads using local storage methods.
